00:16] Nighthawk: Hold on
[00:16] Nighthawk: Idea
[00:16] Nighthawk: Have like an item designation place in the builder
[00:16] Nighthawk: So if you park in the loading area with the correct vehicle
[00:16] nivada: wel if u test vehicle the supply will technicaly stil be there so
[00:16] Nighthawk: With said designation place
[00:16] nivada: u cna be on the job building craft
[00:17] Nighthawk: You can just load up
[00:17] Nighthawk: So lets say I make a truck
[00:17] Not MrVTNsalo: so it basicqlly be a tank
[00:17] nivada: what u mean with jsut load up?
[00:17] Nighthawk: And I select a 40f container designation i nthe builder
[00:17] Nighthawk: It isn't loaded yet but you can see a see trough image of the container in the builder
[00:17] Nighthawk: The you save and spaw nthe vehicle
[00:18] Nighthawk: But it will be without the container
[00:18] Nighthawk: Once you are at the loading area
[00:18] Nighthawk: You click load/load up
[00:18] Nighthawk: And the container will appear at the designated place
[00:18] nivada: ah gotcha
[00:18] Nighthawk: Including however much it weighs
[00:18] Nighthawk: :stuck_out_tongue:
[00:18] nivada: can be interesting for ships yea
[00:18] nivada: but i woudnt allow it for all supply
[00:18] Nighthawk: 40 T O N N E S
[00:19] Not MrVTNsalo: makes ot quite easy
[00:19] Nighthawk: I mean, it would make it very easy for people to make stuff
[00:19] nivada: ship ready containers could do someitn ike this , it makes sence for other stuff
[00:19] nivada: so yea im down with that and should be osible wiht an aditional part
[00:19] Nighthawk: Liquid containers can just exist on the vehicle as the liquid gets pumped in
