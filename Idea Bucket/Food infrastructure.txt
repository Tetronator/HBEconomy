Fishing

NataFish: But in all seriousness, I was thinking about adding an adjustable trawling net. Then depending on how big it is, and where you're fishing, you'd get fish. Which you then need to ship to a processing plant before they expire. Of course you'd also have to move at least a certain speed to trawl, and the line breaks if you move too fast.
