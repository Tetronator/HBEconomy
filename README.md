***Roadmap HB Economy***

The overall idea that this will be player based, and thus; SP & MP. It will not matter what server you are on.

***Stage 1 / V1 - Job Based Economy***

This stage will focus on creating an job board with hauling jobs that people can do. 
*This will stay in the game as this might be another way to earn spacebucks outside of what is described in the diffrent stages.*

Doing it as such we can try out various sorts of resources and perhaps amounts. Be it liquid like fuel or Crude oil or solid containers.
We can allready put in all the map infrastructure to transport goods between. The reward for this could be some sort of score of how you did.

The vision:
You open the TAB menu and open the Jobs section; Here all the current hauling jobs are listed (This job list changes over time)
Then once you have selected a job a waypoint appears indicating where to start
When you arrive at location you will see supply box(es) in a highlighted area which you will need to load up and transport.
When an item leaves the highlighted area the second marker appears indicating the drop off point/destination.
Once arriven at the destination you put the item(s) in the highlighted area.
The job is compelted when all the item(s) have been delivered. Then you get to see a score on how well you did.
The job can be cancelled at any time.




(concept)

***Stage 2 / V2 - World Population***

This stage will be covering the population of the world, meaning;

Creation and Placing of world assets. Example; Mines, Coal power plant, Airports, Ectera.
Creation of job's for the job list. Example; Rescue missions, Interactive tutorial, Move Container from A to B.
Creation of flavour text for said jobs. "Why are we moving this container?"




***Stage 3 / V3 - Fuel Economy***

Expanding upon the previously build map infrastructure we can start making the "Fuel branch" of the "resource tree".
So it will look as such:

Pumpjack/Drilling platform/Oil Rig
**Transport - Crude oil**
Refinery
**Transport - Fuel (Perhaps even allready expanded into Petrol and Diesel fuel)**
Building area/petrol station/Fuel Depot/Airfield hangar

You will need to fuel up your vehicle at those point to even get fuel. 
So you will not start out with a full tank and will need to supply these areas with fuel before you can refuel there.



***Stage 4 / V4 - Expanded Resources Economy***

MINING

Expandign again upon the previously build infrastructure in V1 we can implement other "resource branches" into the "resource tree".
Think of for example;

Iron ore to iron,
Iron ore and coal to Steel,
Bauxite to Aluminium,
Crude Oil to plastic,
Natural Gas refinement,
and so on...

And having these thigns be required and available at the build site for building your vehicles.

***Stage 5 / V5 - Market Economy***

Full fledged market, everything will cost "HB Credits/Spacebucks/BrewCoins" with adjusting prices. (This of course is future music)
